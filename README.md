# SoYouWantToWriteALanguage-
An attempt to write a programming language just for funsies

Some ideas for language design:

High level language that allows multiple languages (ie you can code keywords like 'function' with multiple forms of script)

Geem script, thin Arabic wrapper around Javascript (would this qualify as a language?)
